# Algorithm Identification Using AI

## Overview
This project explores the use of artificial intelligence to identify sorting algorithms implemented in C functions. Various open-source AI models were evaluated for their precision, execution speed, and response consistency.

## Features
- **Automated Testing**: A Python script evaluates AI models on C functions.
- **Prompt Optimization**: Improved interaction with AI models for better results.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarked several models, including Falcon, Mistral, and Llama.
- **Result Logging**: Outputs stored in an Excel file for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**:
  - [OpenPyXL](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): For Excel file manipulation.
  - [LangChain Ollama Integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/ollama/): For interaction with AI models.
  - `sqlite3`, `os`, and `time`: For database handling and performance measurement.

## Key Results
- **Best Model**: Falcon3:7B, offering the best balance of accuracy and speed.
- **Execution Time**: Ranged from 672s to 2575s depending on the model.
- **Response Consistency**: Highlighted variations in AI outputs across multiple runs.
